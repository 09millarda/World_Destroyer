# World_Destroyer

This project is not really even a game to be honest.

The .exe file is located in World_Destroyer/Mwuhahaha/bin/Release/. Download that and run it if you want to test it (All files, it doesn't generate the world files).

So, you are are an evil overlord hellbent and destroying planets and making people's lives a general misery...
It loads up, you choose the size of the world (look at the world files) that contain different numbers of citites, you then choose how many
monsters you want to spawn on the planet. The monsters are spawned randomly across the planet. If two or more monsters are in the city
at the same time then that city is destroyed and the monsters inside it are killed. All cities are connected through eachother to create a
node-map similar to a map of the London Underground (http://roryparle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/standard-tube-map.png). Every turn, 
the monsters choose to move either North, East, South or West the the next city. They cannot travel to cities that have been destroyed. 

The game ends either when all the cities or monsters have been destroyed or after 10,000 cycles. A .txt file is then outputted which shows 
the cities that still stand.

All made in C#, it mainly just shows off OOP skills and polymorphism etc. Nothing special but still, I need something to bulk out my GitHub
account...
